Steps for setting up and running the application locally can also be found below.

## Project Description

This is a dashboard application meant to display live statistics for active astronauts. 
The data is pulled from a api sourced by The Space Devs Launch Library at https://thespacedevs.com/llapi.

(Note: The application presently uses the development API endpoint and the data shown may not be accurate to real life due to being stale and limited. )

The application is built using Vue.js framework to create a SPA. It also incorporates Chart.js in order to render the data, once sorted based on certain criteria and mapped into an array, into multiple charts, tables, and graphs.
